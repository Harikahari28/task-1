    <p>  As the name indicates, there are seven wonderful monuments in this world. This is world full of beautiful buildings and monuments, The <b><i>seven Wonders</i></b> were the most impressive structures 
        known to the ancient Mediterranean world. There were seven of then because it was considered to be a sacred number by ancient Greeks. Important people built magnificient temples and 
        memorials as visible proof  of their power and influence.
    </p>
    <p><h4>The seven wonders of the world are:</h4></p>
    <li><i>Great wall of china</i></li>
    <li><i>Chichen Itza</i></li>
    <li><i>Petra</i></li>
    <li><i>Machu Picchu</i></li>

          <p> The first wonder is <b>Great Wall of China.</b> Its located in chiina border. One of the world’s largest building-construction projects, the Great Wall of China is widely thought to be about 5,500 miles (8,850 km) long; a disputed Chinese study, however, claims the length is 13,170 miles (21,200 km).
             Work began in the 7th century BCE and continued for two millennia. 
             Although called a “wall,” the structure actually features two parallel walls for lengthy stretches.
              In addition, watchtowers and barracks dot the bulwark. One not-so-great thing about the wall, however, was its effectiveness. 
              Although it was built to prevent invasions and raids, the wall largely failed to provide actual security. 
              Instead, scholars have noted that it served more as “political propaganda.”
              <h4><b>History:</b></h4>
              <p>Around 220 B.C.E., <i>Qin Shi Huang</i>, also called the <i>First Emperor</i>, united China.
                 He masterminded the process of uniting the existing walls into one.
                  At that time, rammed earth and wood made up most of the wall.
                   Emperor after emperor strengthened and extended the wall, often with the aim of keeping out the northern invaders. 
                   In some places, the wall was constructed of brick. Elsewhere, quarried granite or even marble blocks were used. 
              The wall was continuously brought up to date as building techniques advanced. <br>
                <pre>                       <img src="image/grt3.jpg" alt="" width="460"height="360"></pre>
              <p><i>Zhu Yuanzhang</i>, who became the <i>Hongwu Emperor</i>, took power in 1368 C.E. He founded the Ming Dynasty, famous for its achievements in the arts of ceramics and painting.
                 The Ming emperors improved the wall with watchtowers and platforms. 
                 Most of the familiar images of the wall show Ming-era construction in the stone. 
                 Depending on how the wall is measured, it stretches somewhere between 4,000 and 5,500 kilometers (2,500 and 3,400 miles).</p>
            <h4><b>overview:</b></h4>
            <p>Many people claim that it is visible from space. But its not true.  Since the wall looks a lot like the stone and soil that surround it, it is difficult to discern with the human eye even from low Earth orbit, and is difficult to make out in most orbital photos.
                 However, this does not detract from the wonder of this astounding ancient structure.</p>

    <h3><b>2.Chichen Itza:</b></h3>
    <pre>                                   <img src="image/itza.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="360"></pre>
    <p><b>Chichén Itzá's</b> ball court is the largest known in the Americas, measuring 554 feet (168 meters) long and 231 feet (70 meters) wide. During ritual games here, players tried to hit a 12-pound (5.4-kilogram) rubber ball through stone scoring hoops set high on the court walls. Competition must have been fierce indeed—losers were put to death.

        Chichén Itzá was more than a <i>religious</i> and <i>ceremonial</i> site. It was also a sophisticated urban center and hub of regional trade. But after centuries of prosperity and absorbing influxes of other cultures like the Toltecs, the city met a mysterious end.
        
        During the 1400s people abandoned Chichén Itzá to the jungle. Though they left behind amazing works of architecture and art, the city’s inhabitants left no known record of why they abandoned their homes. Scientists speculate that droughts, exhausted soils, and royal quests for conquest and treasure may have contributed to Chichén Itzá's downfall.
        
        Recently this World Heritage site was accorded another honor. In a worldwide vote Chichén Itzá was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.</p>
        
        <p>
            The stepped pyramids, temples, columned arcades, and other stone structures of Chichén Itzá were sacred to the Maya and a sophisticated urban center of their empire from A.D. 750 to 1200.
            
            Viewed as a whole, the incredible complex reveals much about the <i>Maya</i> and <i>Toltec</i> vision of the universe—which was intimately tied to what was visible in the dark night skies of the Yucatán Peninsula.
            
            The most recognizable structure here is the Temple of Kukulkan, also known as El Castillo. This glorious step pyramid demonstrates the accuracy and importance of Maya astronomy—and the heavy influence of the Toltecs, who invaded around 1000 and precipitated a merger of the two cultural traditions.
            
            The temple has 365 steps—one for each day of the year. Each of the temple’s four sides has 91 steps, and the top platform makes the 365th.</p>
            <pre>                            <img src="image/itza2.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="360"></pre>
            
            <p>Devising a 365-day calendar was just one feat of Maya science. Incredibly, twice a year on the spring and autumn equinoxes, a shadow falls on the pyramid in the shape of a serpent. As the sun sets, this shadowy snake descends the steps to eventually join a stone serpent head at the base of the great staircase up the pyramid’s side.
            
            The Maya’s astronomical skills were so advanced they could even predict solar eclipses, and an impressive and sophisticated observatory structure remains on the site today.
            
            This great city’s only permanent water source was a series of sinkhole wells. Spanish records report that young female victims were thrown into the largest of these, live, as sacrifices to the Maya rain god thought to live in its depths. Archaeologists have since found their bones, as well as the jewelry and other precious objects they wore in their final hours.Recently this World Heritage site was accorded another honor. In a worldwide vote Chichén Itzá was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.</p>
    <hr><h3><b>Petra:</b></h3>
    <pre>                                   <img src="image/petra2.jpeg" alt="" width="460" height="360"></pre>
    <p>The “Rose City” is a honeycomb of hand-hewn caves, temples, and tombs carved from blushing pink sandstone in the high desert of Jordan some 2,000 years ago. Hidden by time and shifting sand, Petra tells of a lost civilization. Little is known about the Nabateans—a nomadic desert people whose kingdom rose up from these cliffs and peaks, and whose incredible wealth grew from the lucrative incense trade.

Raqmu, or Petra (as the Greeks knew it), grew into the Nabateans’ most prominent city, linking camel caravans between the Mediterranean and Arabian Seas, from Egypt to Syria and beyond to Greece. Control of water sources and an almost magic ability to vanish into the cleft rocks ensured the Nabateans remained unconquered for centuries.

</p>
<p>The Romans arrived in 63 B.C., signaling a new era of massive expansion and grandiose construction, like the theater that sat more than 6,000 spectators, as well as some of the city’s most impressive facades. Carved into the rock face, the Treasury and the Monastery both have unmistakable Hellenistic features, with ornate Corinthian columns, bas-relief Amazons, and fanciful acroteria. Knowing that such architectural feats were achieved by carving from the top down makes it even more impressive.

    Petra’s engineering phenomena are legion, including the sophisticated water system that supported some 30,000 inhabitants. Carved into the twisted passageway of the Siq, the irrigation channel drops only 12 feet over the course of a mile, while underground cisterns stored runoff to be used in drier times of the year.</p>
<pre>                                      <img src="image/pet3.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="360"></pre>
<p>And yet it’s the raw beauty of Petra that draws in so many millions of visitors—the entire city of ruins is a work of art, painted on a natural stone backdrop that changes color every hour. The elegant Silk Tomb swirls with streaks of red, blue, and ocher, while vivid mosaics still pave the floors of a Byzantine-era church.

    Christianity came to Petra in the third and fourth centuries and flourished, but the city waned after an A.D. 336 earthquake and under the early Islamic dynasties of the seventh century.
    
    Petra was only rediscovered by Swiss explorer Johann Burckhardt in 1812, and it continues to spill its secrets. Even now, archaeologists have explored less than half of the sprawling site, and in 2016, with the help of satellite imagery, a monumental structure was found still buried in the sand. It’s no wonder that Petra remains Jordan’s top tourist attraction and one of the most revered of the World Heritage sites.</p>
<br><hr><h3><b>4.Machu Picchu:</b></h3>
<pre>                                    <img src="image/machupichu.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="360"></pre>
<p>Machu Picchu is tangible evidence of the urban Inca Empire at the peak of its power and achievement—a citadel of cut stone fit together without mortar so tightly that its cracks still can’t be penetrated by a knife blade.

    The complex of palaces and plazas, temples and homes may have been built as a ceremonial site, a military stronghold, or a retreat for ruling elites—its dramatic location is certainly well suited for any of those purposes. The ruins lie on a high ridge, surrounded on three sides by the windy, turbulent Urubamba River some 2,000 feet (610 meters) below.
    
    Scholars are still striving to uncover clues to the mysteries hidden here high in the eastern slopes of the Andes, covered with tropical forests of the upper Amazon Basin. Machu Picchu appears to lie at the center of a network of related sites and trails—and many landmarks both man-made and mountainous appear to align with astronomical events like the solstice sunset. The Inca had no written language, so they left no record of why they built the site or how they used it before it was abandoned in the early 16th century.Landscape engineering skills are in strong evidence at Machu Picchu. The site’s buildings, walls, terraces, and ramps reclaim the steep mountainous terrain and make the city blend naturally into the rock escarpments on which it is situated. The 700-plus terraces preserved soil, promoted agriculture, and served as part of an extensive water-distribution system that conserved water and limited erosion on the steep slopes.</p>
<pre>                                   <img src="image/machupichu.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="360"></pre>
<p>The Inca’s achievements and skills are all the more impressive in light of the knowledge they lacked. When Machu Picchu was built some 500 years ago the Inca had no iron, no steel, and no wheels. Their tremendous effort apparently benefited relatively few people—some experts maintain that fewer than a thousand individuals lived here.

    In 1911 a Peruvian guide led Yale professor Hiram Bingham up a steep mountainside and into the history books as the first Western scholar to lay eyes on the “lost city” of Machu Picchu. While indigenous peoples knew of the site, Peru’s Spanish conquerors never did—a fact which aided Machu Picchu’s isolation, and preservation, over the centuries.
    
    Today Machu Picchu is far from isolated. In fact it’s a must-see for any visitor to Peru and the draw that compels many to travel to that nation. Machu Picchu’s management challenge is preservation of the site while making it accessible to all those who hope to experience an incredible part of Inca history.

<br><hr><h3><b>5.Chirst the Redeemer:</b></h3>
<pre>                                   <img src="image/christ.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="360"></pre>
<p>Functioning as Rio de Janeiro‘s dashboard Jesus, the towering “Cristo Redentor” (Christ the Redeemer) gazes out upon a city celebrated more for the pleasures of its flesh than for the saintliness of its sculptures.

    Commissioned in 1922, designed by Brazilian Heitor da Silva Costa, and sculpted by Frenchman Paul Landowski, the mammoth statue sits atop Brazil’s 2,300-foot Corcovado Mountain.
    
    Redeemer became an instant icon in 1931 when a switch was flipped from Rome to bathe the sculpture in inaugural floodlights. Eighty-one years later, fending off vandals and lightning bolts, the soaring Cristo still welcomes all with open arms.</p>

    <p>Redeemer rises from the tropical foliage of Tijuca National Park. Its wilderness is man-made, however. Clear-cut once, the area was replanted by hand in the 1860s. Today the park is the planet’s largest urban forest.
    Planners considered having Jesus hold a globe but chose an image of Christ extending his hands as a symbol of peace.
    The sculpture cost $250,000, donated by individuals from around Brazil.
    Crafted during the height of the art deco movement, Redeemer is the largest sculpture of this style in the world.</p>
    <pre>                               <img src="image/ch3.webp" alt="" width="460" height="360"></pre>
    <p>Even at 130 feet, Redeemer isn’t the largest statue of Christ in the world. There are at least five taller, including “Cristo de la Concordia” in Cochabamba, Bolivia, and “Christ the King” in Swiebodzin, Poland.
    In 2007 Redeemer was nominated to be one of the “New Seven Wonders of the World.”</p> With the help of millions of Brazilians voting by cell phone, it made the list, beating New York’s Statue of Liberty.
    Redeemer has enjoyed cameos in several movies, including Bette Davis’s Now Voyager, Alfred Hitchcock’s Notorious, and the vampire-themed Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn (Part 1). However, Brazilians were offended by 2012, a sci-fi extravaganza in which the sculpture was destroyed.
    In 2006 the Catholic Church declared Redeemer a sanctuary, permitting couples to wed in the chapel at the base.
    Gone are the days when you needed to walk up 220 steps from the summit of Corcovado to reach Redeemer’s base. In 2002, escalators and elevators were installed. For more images <a href="https://www.bing.com/images/feed?form=HDRSC3">click here</a></p>

<hr> <br> <h3><b>6.Colosseum:</b></h3>
<pre>                                    <img src="image/colosseum.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="360"></pre>
<p>The Colosseum, also named the Flavian Amphitheater, is a large amphitheater in Rome. It was built during the reign of the Flavian emperors as a gift to the Roman people.

    Construction of the Colosseum began sometime between C.E. 70 and 72 under the emperor Vespasian. It opened nearly a decade later and was modified several times in the following years. The massive structure measured approximately 189 by 156 meters (620 by 513 feet), towered four stories high, and included eighty entrances to the amphitheater—seventy-six for the patrons, two for participants of events, and two exclusively for the emperor to use. The sheer number of entrances proved to be necessary: the Colosseum could hold more than 50,000 spectators at its maximum capacity.</p>
<pre>                                     <img src="image/cs2.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="360"></pre>
<p>When the Colosseum first opened, the emperor Titus celebrated with a hundred days of gladiatorial games. Emperors traditionally attended the games. The emperor Commodus is known to have performed in the arena on hundreds of occasions. Aside from the games, the Colosseum also hosted dramas, reenactments, and even public executions.

    Eventually, the Romans’ interest in the games waned. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Colosseum began to deteriorate. A series of earthquakes during the fifth century C.E. damaged the structure, and it also suffered from neglect. By the 20th century, nearly two-thirds of the original building had been destroyed. Nevertheless, a restoration project began in the 1990s to repair the Colosseum. Today it is one of modern-day Rome’s most popular tourist attractions, hosting millions of visitors a year.

<hr><br><h3><b>7.Taj Mahal:</b></h3>
<pre>                                    <img src="image/tajmahal.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="360"></pre>
<p>The <b>Taj Mahal</b> is widely considered one of the most beautiful buildings ever created. The exquisite marble structure in Agra, India, is a mausoleum, an enduring monument to the love of a husband for his favorite wife. It's also an eternal testament to the artistic and scientific accomplishments of a wealthy empire.

    <i>Shah Jahan</i>, “the King of the World,” took control of the Mughal Empire throne in 1628 very much in love with the queen he dubbed Mumtaz Mahal or “Chosen One of the Palace.” The poets at Agra’s Mughal court said her beauty was such that the moon hid its face in shame before her.
    
    The Mughals were at the peak of their power and wealth during Shah Jahan’s reign, and India’s rich lode of precious gems yielded him much wealth and power. But he was powerless to stop Mumtaz Mahal’s death during childbirth in 1631. Legend has it that she bound him with a deathbed promise to build her the most beautiful tomb ever known.</p>
<pre>                                   <img src="image/taj2.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="360"></pre>
<p>Promise or no, Shah Jahan poured his passion and wealth into the creation of just such a monument. It is said that 20,000 stone carvers, masons, and artists from across India and as far as Turkey and Iraq were employed under a team of architects to build the Taj Mahal in the lush gardens on the banks of Agra’s Jamuna River. They completed the epic task between 1631 and 1648.

    While the arch-and-dome profile of clean white marble has become iconic, other beauties lie in the Taj Mahal’s painstaking details: inlaid semiprecious stones and carvings and Koranic verse in calligraphy create an enchanting interior space where Shah Jahan came to visit his wife’s remains before he was eventually interred at her side.
    
    The Taj Mahal’s familiar marble domes are framed by four minarets from which Muslims are called to prayer. Each is designed with a slight outward lean, presumably to protect the main mausoleum in case one of them should collapse.</p>
<p>Two red sandstone buildings also flank the main mausoleum on either side. One, to the west, is a mosque. The other is a former guesthouse.

    These buildings are set within lush gardens, complete with an enormous reflecting pool that regularly does what no human has ever been able to accomplish—duplicate the beauty of the Taj Mahal.
    
    Shah Jahan himself gazed upon that beautiful image until the end of his days—but as a prisoner, not a ruler. His son Aurangzeb seized the Mughal throne and imprisoned his father in Agra’s Red Fort (itself a World Heritage site and popular tourist attraction). Whether as consolation or torture, Shah Jahan commanded a view of the Taj Mahal from his window.
